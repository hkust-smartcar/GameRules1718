Teams are ranked according to the time of completion of the tracks on site. Teams who compete in to national finals must submit, in-parallel, the technical documentation report of the car.

The Competition Secretariat makes the following rules for different regional competitions and the national competition on the basis of practicality, to achieve openness, fairness and justice of the competition.

Reviewing the Game Rules and experience from the 12th Competition, to balance the requirements of the current size of the contest and to avoid clone cars from appearing in the same categories, as well as to make convenience for schools with the limited space and compatible tracks to prepare for the competition, the Racing Competition will make settings for the 6 different categories, namely: **A. Quad-Wheel Photoelectric, B: Tri-Wheel Electromagnetic, C: Duo-Wheel Vertical, D: Duo Car Crossover, E: Wireless Power-Saving, F: Beacon Duel**. Details of each category are in latter portions in the documentation.

Apart from the 6 normal categories, there will also be 2 categories of Creative. Details of those will be released separately.

Each institution is limited to sending only 1 team for each different categories. For the number of teams allowed for regional competitions, please follow the rules released by the respective organizing committee for different provinces. Creative teams are to directly apply at the national organizing committee. If regional/provincial competitions have numbers of Creative teams exceeding a certain number, there may be a qualification competition during the regional competitions.
