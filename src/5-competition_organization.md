The regional and national competitions have the same rules. The 2 Photoelectric and Photoelectric Chasing Categories, in principle, is better suitable to be held in the same brighter venue. The 2 Electromagnetic and Electromagnetic Chasing Categories in comparison do not require good lighting environment, so they can be held in the other venues. The 6 Categories are following similar game rules but score ranking are recorded separately.

The live regional and national competitions both consist of preliminary and final, 2 stages. The following rules for preliminary and final competitions are applicable for the 6 regional and final Categories.

After preparation, the referee announces the start of the competition, contestants are to place their cars in the starting region, meaning no part of the car is allowed to exceed the starting line for timing. After the start of the competition, the cars should leave the starting region within 30 seconds and complete a lap along the track. The time is automatically recorded by the starting line timing sensor. After the cars completes a lap and stops, contestants are to retrieve their cars and leave the game fields, and return the car the specified location.

If the competition completes, the automatic score keeper system will give out the resulting score.

## 3. Competition Prizes

The competition follows the principle of "dissemination of regional competitions and elevation of national competition". Under regional competitions, prizes are set in equal ratio to each Category. Each Category qualifies the regional teams, corresponding to the same teams, for competing in the national final competition. <small>(The translation should be perfect. It's just that I don't even know what they mean in Chinese. 😂 May mean: Each category qualifies regional teams, according to the same qualification methods, for competing in the national final competition.)</small>

### (1) Regional Prizes Allocations

-   First Prizes: Top 20% of teams in regional competition.
-   Second Prizes: Top 35% of teams in regional competition.
-   Third Prizes: Remaining Teams who can complete the competition but are not awarded first or second prizes.
